"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",

"@type": "Question","name": "Is Loopcloud any good?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Loopcloud allows you to do a lot of sample manipulation. You can test samples out and see if they work in your project. Although Splices is a neat desktop app, it does not offer many extra features."
