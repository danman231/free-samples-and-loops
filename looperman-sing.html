"@type": "Question","name": "What is the main advantage of looping?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Looping has many advantages. 1 It allows code reuse. 2 We don&#39;t have to write the code over and over again. 3 Loops allow us to traverse the elements in data structures such as arrays or linked lists."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Can humans hear 18hz?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "In ideal laboratory conditions, humans can hear sounds as low as 12Hz and as high at 28kHz. However, the threshold for adults increases dramatically to 15kHz which corresponds to the last auditory canal of the cochlea."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What are the disadvantages of using loops?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "The Scalability Loops allow you to easily scale your code so that it can handle large datasets, or to perform tasks for a certain number of times. Disadvantages: Infinite loops If not controlled properly, loops may result in endless iterations which could cause the program to crash or hang."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is Loopcloud or Splice better?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Splices plugins section is my favorite feature. The ability to search by presets, MIDI or both is also a great tool."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why is sampling legal in music?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Some sampling may be protected by American fair use laws, which allow limited use of copyrighted materials without permission. The owner of the sampled material is not always traceable. This information is often lost through corporate mergers, closures, and buyouts."
